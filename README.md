## Keith Tachibana: Welcome To My GitHub Profile!

Hello and thanks for stopping by. Here you'll find some of the applications I have developed over the years, either solo or in a group, and either for school or for fun. Many are quite simple in terms of the feature set, and honestly a big reason for that is because I simply wanted to try out a new framework I had never used before, or a different tech stack I had never tried yet - you get the picture.

Nowadays, I mainly code in JavaScript/TypeScript since I find web app development the most exciting and the most rewarding as well, especially if you are pair programming or are part of a larger collaborate team effort. The entire process from planning to wireframing to development to production to testing to troubleshooting is a fun, albeit at times frustrating, journey that really demands the best out of you in order to grow and eventually make it to a senior or lead developer position. 

In order to stay on top of all the latest developments being released to see if any are applicable to any of my projects, it really helps to have a dependable source for that type of information. One such resource that I have grown to enjoy reading (and listening to since they also have a podcast) is [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/). Another great website that does an outstanding job of not only reporting on upcoming shifts to the technology sector, but also on its inquiring, testing, and publishing of performance metrics and comparison results of these new technologies, is [AnandTech](https://www.anandtech.com/). The latter, however, is more appropriate for those in IT, admittedly, but nevertheless still has some relevance to developers.
