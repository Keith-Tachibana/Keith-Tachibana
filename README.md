Hello and thanks for stopping by. Here you'll find some of the applications I have developed over the years, either solo or in a group, and either for school or for fun. Many are quite simple in terms of the feature set, and honestly a big reason for that is because I simply wanted to try out a new framework I had never used before, or a different tech stack I had never tried yet - you get the picture.

Nowadays, I mainly code in JavaScript/TypeScript since I find web app development the most exciting and the most rewarding as well, especially if you are pair programming or are part of a larger collaborate team effort. The entire process from planning to wireframing to development to production to testing to troubleshooting is a fun, albeit at times frustrating, journey that really demands the best out of you in order to grow and eventually make it to a senior or lead developer position. 

In order to stay on top of all the latest developments being released to see if any are applicable to any of my projects, it really helps to have a dependable source for that type of information. One such resource that I have grown to enjoy reading (and listening to since they also have a podcast) is [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/). The format of the podcast is basically listening to the host interview an actual programmer or developer for either 60 or 90 minutes, discussing the latest trends in programming, the interviewee's developer's story, his day-to-day responsibilities, the interviewee's company's philosophy on such and such, reasons for doing this or that project, mistakes that were made and lessons learned, etc. All in all, it's usually quite an interesting listen, to say the least.
